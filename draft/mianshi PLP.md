## 自我介绍 Tell me a little about yourself 一点点缺点
首先，我叫韩志鹏，家乡是杭州。
我喜欢设计和构建，所以选择了建筑师作为我的目标。
我在7年的建筑设计学习过程中积累了很多设计方法、新技术和建筑哲学理论。
借此我以优异的成绩拿到了学士和硕士学位。
我学东西非常快，喜欢面对有挑战的问题，比较喜欢钻研新技术。
我非常遵守工作计划，并且我也擅长组织工作，我在学校的合作设计项目中经常担任leader。
如今我准备开始迎接新的挑战。
***
hello everyone， my name is Han Zhipeng from Hangzhou，China.
I love designing and building, so I chose architect as my goal.
I have gained a lot of design methods, new techniques and philosophy theories during my architectural studies.
With this I received my Bachelor and Master degrees with distinction.
***
I am a quick learner, I like to face challenging problems and I prefer to investigate new technologies.
I follow work schedules very closely and I am also good at organising.
I have often been a team leader in design projects at school. I am ready to take on new challenges Now.
***
我的缺点就是，我遇到感短时间内无法解决的问题时，我可能会一直钻研这个问题。在这个时候，这可能就会影响到其他工作的进度。
***
My Disadvantage is that when I face a problem that I feel I can't solve in a short time, I may keep focus on the problem. but This may then affect the progress of other work.



## 介绍
### 1 山地住宅单元
这是一个通过程序生成形体的实验性设计。Ando的Rokko Housing给了我启发，山地建筑可以有一套基本的形体逻辑来应对不同的场地环境。我的设计目的是通过程序生成的建筑形体辅助设计者来应对复杂的山地场地。
首先，我在山地场地图纸中构建简化后的wander算法。调整运行并输出一系列契合环境的path作为构建形态的基础。这个过程中的重点是调整path面对不同的场地元素时的行为。
***
1
This is an experimental design that generates form through program. I was inspired by Ando's Rokko Housing: mountain buildings can have a basic form logic to cope with different site. My aim is to create a program generated building form to assist the designer in dealing with the complex mountain site.
First, I build the simplified wander algorithm in a mountain site plan. The algorithm is adapted, run, and outputs a series of paths that fit the environment and are used as a base framework for building the space.The point of this stage is to adjust how the PATH is affected by the different site elements.
***
下一步，我开始尝试从path生成形体。通过不断迭代算法，以及在不同的地形类型上的实验。path形成了一系列mode，并且不同的mode形成了不同属性的空间。我选择了三种mode，对应三种不同类型的住宅单元模式。
最后，建筑师可以在这些mode的基础上，根据实际功能需要进一步构建细节。
这个过程就为山地住宅单元构建了一个基于算法的方法论。这可以使得空间对山地的适应性更好。并且这些住宅单元进一步可以组合发展为山地村落群。
整个探索性的过程对我来说很有吸引力，每一步的不可预测性使得设计更像是实验的过程。这不仅会让我学到很多，并且这会产生很多意料之外的结果。
***
2
In the next step, I began to experiment with generating forms from path. By keeping iterating the algorithm and experimenting on different terrain types.The path generated a series of modes, and the different modes formed spaces with different properties.I chose three modes, corresponding to three different types of residential units.
This project creates an algorithm-based methodology for mountain residential units. This allows the space to be better adapted to the terrain, saving more on design and construction costs.
The whole explorative Project was fascinating to me and the unpredictability of each step made the design more like an experiment. i think it is the point of this project. Not only did I learn a lot, but this led to many unexpected results.

### 2 Forming Accessiblity 构建可达性
这个项目的背景是底特律持续50年的萧条。城市被隔离成两个部分：一个是建筑内舒适安全的伊甸园，另一个是危机四伏中的野外。这座城市中的建筑被称为“非军事化的防御性建筑”。
我们不可能在短时间内改变现状。我们想要进行一个城市中的空间和经济实验。希望在其中构建可达性，打破城市中的隔离。
***
1-2
The location of this project is downtown Detroit. As a result of the 50 years depression in Detroit, the city was isolated into two parts: a comfortable and safe Eden within the buildings and a dangerous wilderness. The buildings in this city have been described as "demilitarised defensive buildings".
We can't change the depression in a short time. We want to conduct a spatial and economic experiment in the city. and FORMING ACCESSIBILITY in it and break down the isolation in the city.
***
首先，我们从被自然侵蚀的边界中发现城市与自然，Solid and voids，privacy and Public。并且在这些边界中提取语言构建POCHE。
下一步，我们在街区尺度上，把poche语言与城市平面进行拟合，多次迭代发展。并且在更小尺度上具体的建筑空间中，重构剖面中的poche，进一步构建可达性空间。这些空间成为了扩展可达性的边界和孔洞。
这些新的包容性的建筑边缘把公众带回街道，并且产生了空间和视线连接，加强了街道安全，为城市的变革孕育机会。
***
3
Firstly, we think about the city and nature, solid and voids, privacy and public, in the context of building boundaries eroded by nature, and we extract language from these boundaries to build POCHE in plan and sections.
4-6
We fitted the POCHE language to the plane at the Block scale, developing it by several iterations. And to reconstruct the poche in the section in a specific architectural space on a smaller scale. These new spaces become boundaries, bridges and holes that FORMING ACCESSIBILITY.
7-8
These new inclusive architectural boundaries bring the public back to the street and generate spatial and visual connections that not only enhance street safety but also breed opportunities for urban evolution. This is the main content of this project.

### 3 Underwater Temple
GANGES Water purification tower IN INDIA是一个结合净水功能和恒河传统节日Kumbh Mela的建筑。
恒河是印度教最神圣的河流，它也是数以百万计的底层印度人的生命线。
然而，恒河遭受着极端的污染，大量城市的污水、工业垃圾、污染物被排放到河流中。这是由生活在恒河附近的4亿人造成的。
***
1-2
The Underwater Temple IN INDIA is a building that combines the water purification function with the traditional festival of Kumbh Mela on the Ganges. 
The Ganges is India's most sacred river, and it is also the lifeline for millions of Indians.
However, the Ganges suffers from extreme pollution, with large amounts of sewage, industrial waste and pollutants from the city being released into the river. This is caused by the 400 million people who live near the Ganges.
***
我们在前期调研发现田螺和牡蛎具有高效的净水能力，并通过实验证明了它们净化水的可能。
我们从最小的单元开始探索，用极小曲面构建田螺的附着空间。然后通过极小曲面的组合和延伸来创造一系列不同尺度和属性的空间。
通过多个单元的组合，水下垂直寺庙被构建起来。人们可以用潜水装备潜水进入，也有不同高度的平台提供祭拜的空间和舞台。这些空间也同时是田螺的栖息地，当地渔民也会养殖田螺获取收益。
当它也在不断的改善恒河的水质时候，宏伟的水下寺庙就成为圣地恒河中的圣地。
***

In our previous research, we found that snails and oysters are highly effective in purifying water, and we have proved through experiments that they are highly effective in it.
We started the design from the smallest unit, using minimal surface to build the space of attachment of the snails. We then combine and extend the minimal surfaces to create a series of spaces of different scales and functions.
3
Further, through the combination of several units, underwater temples are constructed. It can be accessed by diving equipment, and there are also platforms of different heights that provide spaces and stages for worship. 
These spaces also provide a habitat for snails, which are farmed for profit by local fishermen.
When it is constantly improving the water quality of the Ganges, the magnificent underwater temple becomes a sacred site in it.

### 4 Freezing Art History in Space
这个项目中我们希望借助AI，将绘画和雕塑的艺术风格凝固在建筑空间中。
格拉斯哥艺术大学（GSA）建于新艺术运动时期，由麦金托什设计。然而，它在两场大火中遭到严重破坏。如何重建成为了当时争论不断的问题。
我们把这个设计问题作为基础，通过机器学习辅助设计，进行空间生成实验。保留gsa灾后现存的结构作为框架，加入新艺术主义风格训练下的ai生成的空间，重建gsa的教学楼。
首先，我们做了一些文献综述，选择了机器学习中的CNN（卷积神经网络）作为ai训练模型。
***
1
For this project I wanted to use AI to freeze the artistic style of painting and sculpture in the architectural space. The Glasgow School of Art (GSA) was built during the Art Nouveau period and designed by Mackintosh. However, it was severely damaged in two fires. How to rebuild it became a controversial issue at the time.
We use this design problem as a basis for experiments in space generation through machine learning. We kept the existing building structure of the gsa after the fire as a framework and added ai-generated spaces trained in many styles to reconstruct the gsa.
Firstly, we did some research on papers and chose CNN in machine learning as the ai training model.
***
第二步，我们将三维空间切片成为一系列二维剖面。把这些二维剖面输入经过训练的模型会输出新艺术风格影响下的新剖面。不同的建筑部分对应不同风格的作品进行训练。
下一步，这些风格化二维图像被重新组合形成三维空间切片。进一步通过图像像素提取体素点。这些包含不同信息的点云被筛选分组，以对应不同的材料和拟合方式。
最后，被处理之后的有效的体素点拟合形成空间实体，代替那些被烧毁的部分。
这个过程中我们设想了一种利用现在日益成熟的图像ai技术来构建特殊的建筑空间的方法。通过阅读文献在现有的技术上进一步的探索是我在这个项目最大的收获。
***
2
next step, we sliced the space into a series of 2D sections. Feeding these 2D sections into the trained model will output new stylised sections. Different building sections correspond to different styles for training.
3
These stylised 2D images are recombined to form 3D spatial slices. Voxel points are extracted through the image pixels. These point clouds containing different information are filtered and grouped to correspond to different materials and fitting methods.
Finally, these valid voxel point fits after being processed form the space that replaces those parts that are fired.
4
In this project we experimented with a method of using the increasingly mature ai to construct special architectural spaces. Reading papers and exploring further on the basis of existing techniques was my biggest reward from this project.
***

### 转折
本科期间我一直在研究通过各种方法论构建形式以及建筑语言，而我认为我缺少的是形式背后的哲学思考。所以我选择了在爱丁堡完成我的硕士学位。
***
During my undergraduate studies I have been researching the generation of form and the language of architecture through various methodologies, and what I think I was missing most was the philosophical thinking behind the form. So I chose to complete my Master degree in Edinburgh.

### 5 Proximity Theater
这是一个关注于城市的底层哲学和城市主义的研究项目。主要有两个部分，设计研究部分和关于多种城市主义和建筑哲学的论文部分。
***
This project focusing on the social philosophy of the city and urbanism. There are two main parts, a design research part and a thesis part on multiple urbanisms.
***
我们从爱丁堡八月的艺术节得到灵感。通过在爱丁堡老城中一系列proximity theater作为干预点作为主体化的开始，将royal mile两侧的一系列closes沉浸在表演的氛围（atmosphere）中。由此来形成一种新的城市主义，这是对全球化资本主义引导的城市化的一种抗争。
项目的重点是以closes独特的狭小空间作为载体, 我们将这些空间重构为proximity Theater的一部分。 从观众和演员的body尺度的舞台表演发展到老城中76条closes的城市尺度上新的城市节日。Performative Urbanism在爱丁堡的四个尺度上的涌现，使得爱丁堡沉浸在节日的氛围中。新的生态学价值体系在这个过程中产生。我们把这种在爱丁堡中自下而上的生态学实践称为，Synecdoche, Edinburgh，PARA-situation [Edinburgh]。
***
1-2
We took inspiration from Edinburgh International Festival. By using a series of proximity theatres in Edinburgh's Old Town as a point of intervention as the beginning of subjectification, a series of closes spaces on either side of the Royal Mile are immersed in the atmosphere of performance. This has led to the creation of a new urbanism-Proximity Paradiam, which is a resistance to the urbanisation guided by globalised capitalism.

The focus of the project is to build proximity theatre in the uniquely small space of the closes and to use the street space as part of the theatre. The development from body-scale theatrical performances for audiences and performers to new urban festivals on urban scale of 76 closes in the Old Town. The emergence of Performative Urbanism on four scales immersed Edinburgh in a festival atmosphere. A new ecological value system emerges from this process. We call this ecological practice in Edinburgh from the inside out, Synecdoche, Edinburgh, PARA-situation [Edinburgh].
***
具体的来说，我们通过实践形成一系列方法论。基于表演的主题，我们利用光影和film形成boundary的实体化，并且将其迭代，再次投射在光影之中，使得模型再次迭代形成建筑语言。
在具体的空间中我们利用在closes空间中观察人的行为作为故事的线索，利用叙事性建筑和沉浸式剧院的构建方式，像是一个导演一样构建了具体的剧院空间。并且我们使用来copper来隐喻不同主体间相互渗透的部分。
生活的爱丁堡老城中的人们为了一个共同的意识、目标、归属感在一起策划、准备、制作、庆祝。我们用光线穿过多层的城市模型来表达这个在城市尺度的、上自下而上的生态学社会体系。
***
3-4
Specifically, we have developed a series of methodologies through our practice. Based on the theme of performance, we use light, shadow and film to form a materialisation of the boundary and iterate it, projecting it again in light and shadow, so that the model forms architectural language again. 
5-6
In the specific space we use the history and life of Edinburgh's Old Town as a story line, using narrative architecture and immersive theatre as a director to build the specific theatre space. And we use the copper as a metaphor for the interpenetrating parts of the different subjects.
7-8
People living in Edinburgh's Old Town plan, prepare, make and celebrate together for a common sense, purpose and sense of belonging. We use light through the multi-layered city model to express this ecological social system at an urban scale, from the inside out.
***
exhibition部分也同样表达了synecdoche Edinburgh的概念，将整个展厅理解为爱丁堡，而展架是舞台，作品是演员。我们通过光与影形成独特的效果。
而在论文部分具体阐述了这些概念逻辑产生过程 和 方法论的实验迭代过程。
这个项目被eca选中，我借此拿到了distinction。
***
9-10
The exhibition also expresses the synecdoche Edinburgh, with the Studio as Edinburgh, and the exhibition space as the stage and the models as the actors. We create a unique effect through light and shadow. 
The thesis section specifies the process by which these conceptual logics emerged and the experimental iterations of the methodology.
The project was selected by eca and I got distinction for this project.

### appendix
这是我在gad的实习项目。我主要参与了衢州礼贤未来社区的街区公共空间设计和加油站改建设计。我把加油站的屋顶一直错落融入到双水公园中，让加油站成为公园的一部分。并且遵循模块化的基本单元，可以大幅度缩短改建和维护的成本和时间，增加可持续性减少加油站对于周边居住区生态绿色环境的影响。
***
This is my internship project at gad. I was mainly involved in the design of the public space and the renovation of the petrol station for the future community of Lixian in Quzhou. I integrated the roof of the gas station into the Shuangshui Park by reducing its height layer by layer, making the gas station a part of the park. 
It also follows the modular unit, which significantly reduces the cost and time of renovation and maintenance, and increases sustainability and reduces the ecological and green impact of the station on the surrounding residential area.

## 可以用哪些软件
我最擅长的是 Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, cad。渲染类软件我擅长V-Ray，enscape 我的作品中几乎所有的渲染都是在vray中完成的。adobe系列主要擅长ID PS AI，我还会一些Pr的基础技能。因为一直在研究参数化设计和机器学习，我能用python调参数，或者编写一些小脚本。
我正在学习houdini和revit，但是还没有项目经验。
***
I'm best at Rhino, Grasshopper, cad. rendering software I'm good at V-Ray, enscape and almost all of my work is rendered in vray. adobe suite is mainly ID PS AI and I have some basic skills in Pr. As I have been working on parametric design and machine learning, I can write small scripts in python. I am learning houdini and revit, but have no project experience yet.

## 为什么选择PLP，喜欢PLP的哪一点
创造性和高质量工作方式和环境对于我来说非常重要。
PLP的项目一直保持着各种新建筑技术和形态的探索。并且这些都为建筑的结构和实际使用服务，而不只是为了浮夸的形体。这些结构和技术需要大量的细节设设计。PLP对于大尺度整体空间氛围和小尺度建筑细节的把控都做到了极致。比如说
ONE BISHOPSGATE PLAZA, LONDON, UK
能参与到这些地标性的高质量的建筑设计工作中，是我作为刚毕业的设计师所向往的。
我非常想在PLP开始新的人生阶段。这是我的梦想工作。
***
Creativity and high quality working styles and environments are very important to me.The projects at PLP have always maintained the exploration of various new building techniques and forms. These serve the structural and practical experience of the building and are not just about flashy forms. These structures and techniques require a great deal of detailed design work.
PLP has achieved the ultimate in control of both the overall spatial atmosphere on a large scale and the architectural details on a small scale. 
ONE BISHOPSGATE PLAZA, LONDON, UK
Being involved in these landmark, high quality architectural designs is the work I aspire to do as a graduated designer.I want to start a new career at PLP. And this is my dream job.

## 未来发展想法 
现在我希望能在这个世界顶级的设计团队工作2年以上。最重要的是能够在PLP位于全球的各种项目中积累经验，成长为成熟建筑师。并且能够在PLP学到更多新技术。
***
I hope to work for more than 2 years in this world class design team. The most important thing is to be able to learn and gain experience in a variety of projects at PLP. Growing into a mature architect. And learning new skills at PLP.

我在伦敦实地参过三次。它为周围的城市空间带来了独特的精致优雅的体验。
彭博拱廊现在是人们在城市中移动的主要路线。我非常喜欢bronze在其中的使用，a series of large-scale bronze fins不仅是遮阳 节能 通风系统的一部分，又使得整个建筑氛围变得与周围历史建筑一致的庄重，充满了历史的厚重感。
在实地体验中，这些bronze fins非常巨大且精致优雅，它们的施工精度和实际效果真的让我非常震撼。这让我开始思考，并不是非常特殊的形式才可以给人带来强烈的情感价值。
同样的内部Clad in bronze的 the Vortex 和polished aluminium panels of ‘petals’以及其他内部细节也与外部一致，美观又同时是建筑功能和节能技术的重要部分。
***
I have visited the site three times. It brings a unique experience of refined and elegant urban space to the surrounding area.
The Bloomberg Arcade is now the main route for people moving around the city. I really like the use of bronze in this, a series of large-scale bronze fins that are not only part of the shading, energy saving and ventilation system, but also give the whole building a dignified atmosphere, full of historical weight. This is in keeping with the surrounding historic buildings.
In the field, these bronze fins are very large and elegant. I was really impressed by the accuracy of their construction and the actual effect. It made me start thinking about how it gives me such strong emotional value.
The Vortex clad in bronze and polished aluminium panels of 'petals' and other interior details are also consistent with the exterior, They are beautiful and an important part of the building's functionality and energy-efficient technology.
