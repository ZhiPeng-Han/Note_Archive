我从小就对超级英雄电影很感兴趣，总是希望自己有超能力打败反派。
if only superheroes really existed. the world would be a much better place.
但是现在觉得，虽然超级英雄在电影中常常拯救世界，但是在现实他们可能带来灾难
如果我有超能力，我会帮助国家建造基建
在武汉封城期间，武汉医院的院长就是现实的中的英雄，他顶着重病医治了无数患者
从这位院长的身上我学到了坚守和责任，并且希望让爱传递出去

首先我觉得生命迭代的过程对于整个物种的进化非常重要，人类想要进步就不可能长生不老
First of all, I think the process of human iteration is very important for the evolution of the whole species. If we want to make progress, we cannot live forever
我相信，随着科技的发展我们可能可以通过上传意识来获得另一种方式上的永生
I believe, with the development of technology, we may be able to gain another way of immortality by uploading consciousness
With eternal life, i would outlive everyone i ever knew and loved, which would cause me unbearable pain.
有限的生命激励我去做更多有意义的事情。
The limited life inspires me to do more meaningful things.
如果我长生不老，我可能就会无止境的消磨时间。
If I were to live forever, I would probably kill time endlessly.

**谁的青春不叛逆**

my parents gave up on me after i kept skipping classes and playing video games without their permission.
i used to rebel against everything when i was young
there was almost nothing my parents and teacher could do to control my behavior
我12岁之后，叛逆的情况才逐渐好转
After I was 12 years old, the rebellious situation gradually improved
现在来看，我觉当时叛逆的行为很可笑
Looking back on it now, I find that act of rebel is ridiculous

Those who put the career in first priority, there is an ideal in the heart, they should be determined to fight for it

Nowadays, consumerism become more and more common in many parts of the world. As a way to be more environmentally friendly, shopping on the second-hand stores can help us protect environment. I will choose some old colorful cloth or second-hand home appliances, if I go to thrift stores. This can help me to save money and find some extraordinary items. This experience like a treasure hunt. But the habit of shopping on the thrift stores might impact on development of economic.

Consumerism can promotes competition in the marketplace. Competition allows consumers to use better goods. This also might make goods cheaper. Reasonable market competition is always good for consumers. On the other hand, consumerism can cause more waste of resources. Too many goods have been produced, part of this are useless for consumers. This also can lead to excessive energy use, which have negative impacts on environment.
