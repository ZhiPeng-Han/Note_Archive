During my undergraduate studies, I have not only been serious about developing my architectural skills, but I have also been exploring the possibilities of digital architectural design and construction. I am able to use procedural automation and mathematical logic to come up with solutions to complex problems in design, and with the ambiguity of AI I can give more design possibilities. I have acquired Grasshopper and basic Python skills.

But I think it is essential for architects to detach themselves from the temptation that comes with a plethora of new technologies. During my time in Edinburgh I thought carefully about the clash of Eastern and Western cultures, and a series of methodologies emerged from philosophical musings, changes in scales and other more fundamental reflections. These will guide my soul in my future work.

During my college years, I was ignorant, interesting, and bored with architecture at the beginning, and then became calm, thinking, and aware that architecture is a profound subject, including design philosophy, life experience, sociology, physics, logic, aesthetics, humanistic history, economy and so on. These thoughts and organizations form architectural systems.
In terms of architectural concept, I think the building stands on the ground like a big tree, and each branch is the spatial logic point or technology, which together constitute a complex architectural entity. In recent years, the construction industry has calmed down from the early explosive growth, and design has begun to have the depth to think about design. Architectural design has its core driving force, architecture has its soul. Lack of driving force is also the most serious problem when I do design projects.
I think that in the future, architecture will gradually lower the threshold, as all the broad design industries do, so that the driving force of design will fit the reality. And the use of computer algorithms and Internet platforms will be fertile ground for all this development.

在大学期间，对建筑从一开始的懵懂，有趣，厌烦，到后来的冷静，思考，沉淀，觉知建筑学是极有深度的学科，设计理念，生活经验，社会学，物理，逻辑，美学，人文历史，经济等等。这些思考和组织形成建筑学体系
在建筑理念上，我觉得建筑立于大地好似一棵大树，每一个枝干是其中的空间逻辑点或技术，共同组成了复杂的建筑实体。近年，建筑行业从早期的爆发性增长中慢慢冷静下来，设计开始有深度，思考为什么而设计。建筑设计在有了其核心的驱动力，建筑才有了灵魂。缺少驱动力也是我做设计方案时最严重的问题
我思考在未来，建筑将会像所有泛设计行业一样，逐渐将门槛放低，这样设计的驱动力才会和实际契合。而计算机的算法使用和互联网平台将会时这一切发展的肥沃土壤
